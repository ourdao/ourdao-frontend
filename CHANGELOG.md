# Changelog

Member-visible changes to the OurDAO frontend. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This app is one of three repositories that have to stay compatible, so every
release names the backend and contract builds it was written against:

- **Backend** — the `ourdao-backend` release or commit whose response shapes
  `src/lib/backend.ts` consumes.
- **Contracts** — the `ourdao-contracts` commit recorded in
  `contract/interface.json` (`_last_verified`). Update both together.

The running build's version is shown at the foot of the app sidebar, so a bug
report can name the entry below it came from. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog) for when an entry is required.

## [Unreleased]

Backend: ourdao-backend unversioned (main; no tagged release to pin yet)
Contracts: ourdao-contracts @ 00b0c62

### Added
- The app version and commit are shown at the foot of the sidebar and mobile
  navigation drawer, so a bug report can name the build it came from (#250).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-26

`package.json` has sat at 0.1.0 since the project started, so this entry
backfills everything deployed from `main` up to d44e397. Before #161
(2026-08-31) nothing recorded which contract build the app targeted.

Backend: ourdao-backend unversioned (main; no tagged release to pin yet)
Contracts: ourdao-contracts @ 00b0c62

### Added
- Offline handling and a cleaned-up installable PWA manifest (#296).
- A network badge in the header showing which Stellar network the wallet is on (#165).
- Partial loan repayment (#162).
- Proposals awaiting treasury funds, and contract failure events, now appear in
  governance and the activity feed (#175, #176).
- Loan detail page reads the real disbursed loan: status, due date, and
  outstanding balance.
- Admin page built on live contract state: pause/unpause, add/remove admin,
  consensus threshold, and an admin audit log.
- Light and dark themes with a header toggle.
- Per-route page titles and Open Graph/Twitter cards (#7).
- Explorer links for transactions and accounts (#95).

### Changed
- Documents are closed by default and the loan policy is read on-chain
  instead of from constants (#284).
- Maximum loan amount is derived from the treasury balance; the unused
  Cancelled status was dropped (#282).
- Member status labels match the contract enum (#187).
- Proposals are listed newest-first and paginated (#102).
- Backend stats and loan shapes aligned with ourdao-backend (#287).
- Notification panel rebuilt for keyboard focus and Escape handling (#99).
- Freighter version is detected, wallet watching pauses in hidden tabs, and
  signature requests time out instead of hanging (#285).

### Fixed
- Dates are formatted in the member's locale (#291).
- Token amounts display and parse without precision loss (#62, #286).
- Vote controls are disabled once a member has already voted (#118).
- Switching accounts in Freighter no longer shows the previous account's
  data (#98, #286).
- Writes are blocked when Freighter and the app are on different networks.
- Every transaction submission status is handled, not just errors (#129).
- Loan requests keep their purpose, privacy, and document fields (#33).
- Pages refresh after a successful write instead of showing stale data (#32).
- Document uploads use a working IPFS pinning route with gateway fallback
  (#123, #282), cap upload size (#177), and forward permissions (#181).
- Dashboard Recent Activity labels every event instead of "Unknown event occurred".
- Pinch-zoom is allowed (WCAG 1.4.4) (#126), continuous animations honour
  prefers-reduced-motion (#127), and icon-only controls have accessible names (#93).

### Removed
- Fabricated team, testimonial, and statistics content from the landing page.
