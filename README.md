# OurDAO Frontend

[![CI](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-frontend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-frontend/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web app for the **OurDAO** member-owned lending DAO on **Stellar Soroban**.

- **Wallet:** [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) via `@stellar/freighter-api`
- **Chain access:** `@stellar/stellar-sdk` (Soroban RPC — simulate for reads, prepare/sign/submit for writes)
- **Contract:** the [`ourdao-contracts`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-contracts) Soroban DAO
- **Off-chain data:** the [`ourdao-backend`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-backend) indexer/API, for anything the contract itself keeps no queryable history of

This repository is one of three that make up OurDAO:

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| [`ourdao-contracts`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-contracts) | The Soroban contract — the single source of truth for all DAO state |
| [`ourdao-backend`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-backend) | Off-chain indexer + read API |
| **`ourdao-frontend`** (this repo) | Next.js web app members actually use |

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then edit values (all optional; testnet defaults)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Install the **Freighter** browser extension to connect a wallet.

## Configuration

All config is env-driven with public-testnet defaults (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` | Deployed OurDAO contract id (`C…`) | _(empty → read-only "not configured")_ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` | Network passphrase | testnet |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY` | Gateway for document content hashes | Pinata |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` | [`ourdao-backend`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-backend) indexer/API (loan history, notifications, admin log, events) | `http://localhost:4000` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public site origin, no trailing slash — used as `metadataBase` so Open Graph/Twitter image URLs resolve to an absolute address | `http://localhost:3000` |

Without a `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID` the UI runs and renders, but on-chain reads/writes are disabled until you point it at a deployed contract. Without a reachable backend, everything backend-derived (loan history, notifications, activity/admin logs) degrades to empty rather than erroring — see `src/lib/backend.ts`.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/` | Landing page — product overview, live DAO stats, wallet connect entry point. |
| `/register` | Join the DAO (pays the membership fee via a real contract call). |
| `/dashboard` | Member home: membership status, voting weight, pending yield, quick actions, DAO-wide stats, recent activity. |
| `/loans` | Browse and vote on loan proposals. |
| `/loans/request` | Multi-step loan request form. |
| `/loans/[id]` | Loan detail — proposal vote state, and once approved, the real disbursed loan's status (Active/Repaid/Defaulted), due date, and a permissionless "Mark as Defaulted" action once overdue. |
| `/governance` | Browse and vote on both loan and treasury proposals in one place. |
| `/governance/create` | Create a treasury withdrawal proposal (optionally private, via commit-reveal). |
| `/treasury` | Treasury balance, staking (stake/unstake for voting-weight boost), claimable yield. |
| `/privacy` | What's actually private on-chain (commit-reveal voting, document encryption) and how to use it. |
| `/admin` | Admin-only: pause/unpause, add/remove admins, set consensus threshold, governance audit log. |

## Architecture

```
src/
  app/            # Next.js App Router pages (one folder per route above)
  components/     # Shared UI: AppShell (header/sidebar), ConnectButton, NotificationCenter,
                  # ThemeToggle, DocumentUpload, and the shadcn/ui-derived primitives in ui/
  hooks/          # useDAO.ts (contract reads/writes as React Query hooks),
                  # useNotifications.ts (backend-polled notifications + activity feed),
                  # useNow.ts (a useSyncExternalStore-based clock for countdown displays)
  lib/            # stellar.ts, wallet.tsx, dao-client.ts, backend.ts, ipfs.ts, utils.ts
  types/          # Shared TypeScript types
```

`AppShell` (header + sidebar navigation) is rendered by each page individually rather than being a Next.js `layout.tsx` — every page wraps its content in `<AppShell>` instead of hand-rolling its own chrome. The landing page and `/register` are the exceptions, with their own standalone headers since they're meant to work before a user has any DAO context.

Data flows through [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) throughout: `useDAO.ts`'s hooks wrap live Soroban contract reads (the contract itself has no queryable lists, so proposal/loan enumeration counts come from the indexer, then each item is fetched live by id straight from the contract — the count is an off-chain hint, the data is always on-chain-sourced) and Freighter-signed writes; `useNotifications.ts` wraps the backend's polled REST endpoints.

## Where the Stellar integration lives

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/stellar.ts` | Network config, RPC client, explorer URLs |
| `src/lib/wallet.tsx` | Freighter connect/disconnect/sign context (`useWallet`) |
| `src/lib/dao-client.ts` | Soroban read/invoke + typed wrappers for every contract method |
| `src/components/ConnectButton.tsx` | Freighter connect/disconnect UI |
| `src/hooks/useDAO.ts` | React Query hooks the pages consume |

## Theming

Light/dark is handled by [`next-themes`](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) (`ThemeProvider` in `src/components/providers.tsx`, toggled via `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` in the header), following the system preference by default and persisting a manual choice in `localStorage`. Colors are Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens defined in `src/app/globals.css` — a `.dark` class override block flips the semantic set (`background`, `foreground`, `card`, `muted`, `border`, etc.) that `src/components/ui/*` is built against.

Two things worth knowing if you're touching styling:
- Those `ui/` primitives referenced this token set from the start, but the tokens themselves were never actually defined until this was fixed — `bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, and friends were silently unstyled before.
- `cn()` (`src/lib/utils.ts`) runs through [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge), not just `clsx` — this matters because a component's default variant classes (e.g. `Button`'s default `bg-primary`) and a caller's override classes (e.g. `bg-white`) will otherwise both compile to real CSS rules, and which one wins visually depends on Tailwind's generated stylesheet order rather than which class is written later. `tailwind-merge` resolves that by intent instead.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # dev server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build     # production build
npm start         # serve the production build
npm run lint      # eslint
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
npm test          # vitest
```

## Testing

Vitest + Testing Library, jsdom by default (pure-logic suites that don't need the DOM, like the Soroban ScVal builders, opt into the Node environment per-file via `// @vitest-environment node`). Coverage: `dao-client.ts`'s ScVal builders and `policyToScVal`, `backend.ts`'s fetch wrappers (including its fail-soft-on-error behavior), `useDAO.ts`'s pure mapping helpers (including `mapLoan`, the real disbursed-loan mapper), `useNotifications.ts`'s hooks, and `useNow.ts`'s `useSyncExternalStore` contract (using fake timers, since the underlying bug it guards against — an infinite render loop — doesn't reproduce reliably just by rendering in jsdom). CI runs lint, typecheck, test, and build on every push/PR — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Two more jobs run alongside, kept separate from those four so an unrelated advisory or a generous, PR-controllable size budget never blocks a PR that has nothing to do with either: a dependency `audit` (see [Dependency hygiene](#security-notes)) that never fails the run (warns instead), and a `bundle-size` check that compares the client JS/CSS shipped from `.next/static` against the latest `main` baseline, only failing on a >5%-and->10 KB gzip regression.

## What's real vs. not

Most of the app is wired to the live contract + backend: registration, loan request/vote/repay, treasury propose/vote, staking, name registry, commit-reveal private voting, document content-hash attachment, notifications, admin actions (pause/unpause, add/remove admin, set consensus threshold), an admin/governance audit log, and loan defaults — `markLoanDefaulted` is exposed in `dao-client.ts`, and the dashboard's Recent Activity feed labels every real event (including `loan_dflt`) instead of a generic placeholder. The loan detail page (`/loans/[id]`) reads the contract's real disbursed `Loan` (via `useLoan`) once a proposal is approved — actual status, due date, and outstanding balance, not proposal-status guesswork that never reflected repayment or default.

One known gap remains:

- **IPFS document storage** (`src/lib/ipfs.ts`) — the encryption (AES-GCM) is real, but the upload/download target (Infura's IPFS gateway) has been shut down. Needs a real pinning provider (Pinata/web3.storage) + API key before it actually stores anything.

`tsc --noEmit` is fully clean and enforced in CI. `next.config.ts` no longer sets `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` — `next build` now fails on type errors just like the CI `typecheck` gate (the `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` counterpart was removed outright in the Next 16 upgrade — that config key no longer exists).

Running on Next.js 16 (Turbopack by default) + React 19.2.

## Security notes

- **No custody.** The frontend never holds a private key — every signature happens inside the Freighter extension, in the user's own browser context. `src/lib/wallet.tsx` only ever receives a signed transaction XDR back, never a key.
- **Read-only degradation, not silent failure.** Without a configured contract id or a reachable backend, the UI runs in an explicit "not configured" / empty state rather than throwing — see [Configuration](#configuration).
- **Error boundaries.** `error.tsx` (route-segment) and `global-error.tsx` (root-layout-level) catch uncaught render errors and offer a retry instead of the previous behavior, where any single uncaught error anywhere in the tree would take down the entire client-side app with no recovery short of a hard reload.
- **Dependency hygiene.** A critical Next.js RCE and several other npm audit findings were patched. The rest is enforced automatically rather than tracked by hand: a separate `audit` job in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `audit-ci` (config: `audit-ci.jsonc`) on every PR at the moderate-and-above threshold, so a new advisory is caught the day it lands instead of at the next manual review. It's a non-blocking job (visible as a warning, doesn't fail the run) since a fresh advisory affects every open PR at once, not just the one that happens to trigger it. The only findings currently allowlisted are rooted entirely in `ipfs-http-client`'s dependency tree (tracked against the IPFS gap above); each is allowlisted by exact GHSA id with an expiry date, after which it starts failing again until someone deliberately re-reviews and extends it or the dependency is fixed/replaced — see the comments in `audit-ci.jsonc`. [Dependabot](.github/dependabot.yml) opens security-update PRs automatically as advisories get patched upstream, and batches routine (non-security) version bumps into a weekly grouped PR so they don't flood the queue — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)'s note on unrelated dependency bumps.

## Roadmap

- Replace the dead IPFS/Infura endpoint with a real pinning provider.
- Rework the loan detail page's data model so it derives loan/proposal state more directly (some legacy fields still shadow real on-chain data in places not yet fully migrated).
- Convert `DocumentViewer.tsx`'s manual fetch-in-effect to React Query, matching the rest of the app's data-fetching convention (currently unused in the app, flagged rather than silently left as-is).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for local setup, the checks CI enforces, and the frontend-specific rules (no fabricated content, TanStack Query for all data fetching, `cn()` for class composition, both themes verified). Please claim an issue before opening a pull request.
