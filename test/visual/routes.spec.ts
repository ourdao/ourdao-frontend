/**
 * Snapshot matrix for the main routes (#270): every route × {light, dark},
 * run once per viewport project (desktop / mobile) defined in
 * playwright.config.ts.
 *
 * Routes are captured in their wallet-disconnected state — CI has no
 * Freighter extension, and those gates are real UI worth protecting.
 * Deliberately not snapshotted (see docs/visual-tests.md):
 *   - /loans/request redirects to / without a wallet, so it would only ever
 *     picture the landing page;
 *   - /loans/[id] raises a transient "Loan not found" toast on load, which is
 *     not deterministic enough to baseline;
 *   - /governance/create and /admin additionally render Member Only /
 *     Access Denied gates that ARE captured below.
